## [v0.1.0] - 2025-3-27
### Added
- Add Decision Tree model
- Add following functions to math.rs:
    - `entropy`: Calculates the entropy of a label set
    - `gini`: Calculates the Gini impurity of a label set
    - `information_gain`: Calculates the information gain when splitting a dataset
    - `gain_ratio`: Calculates the gain ratio for a dataset split
    - `mean_squared_error`: Calculates the Mean Squared Error (MSE) of a set of values

### Changed
- Replaced string-based distance calculation method options with an enum `crate::machine_learning::DistanceCalculation`
- For KNN model: replaced string-based weight function options with an enum `crate::machine_learning::knn::WeightingStrategy`
- For decision tree: replaced string-based algorithm options with an enum `crate::machine_learning::decision_tree::Algorithm`

## [v0.1.0] - 2025-3-27
### Added
- Add changelog.md to record updates
- Add DBSCAN model
- Add function `fit_predict` to fit and predict in one step
- Add doc comments to tell user `p` value of function `minkowski_distance` in model is always 3

## [v0.1.0] - 2025-3-26
### Added
- Add "xx model converged at iteration x, cost: x" when finishing `fit`
- Add description for `n_iter` field

## [v0.1.0] - 2025-3-25
### Added

### Changed
- Change the output of all `predict` functions(except KNN) from `T` to `Result<T, crate::ModelError>`
- Correct doc comments
